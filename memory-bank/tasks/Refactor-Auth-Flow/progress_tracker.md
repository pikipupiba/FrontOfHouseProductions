## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Description | Status | Estimated Completion |
|-------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Planning** | Architecture design and planning | âœ… Completed | 3/18/2025 |
| **Phase 1** | Core Infrastructure | âœ… Completed | 3/18/2025 |
| **Phase 2** | Server-Side Components | âœ… Completed | 3/18/2025 |
| **Phase 3** | Client-Side Integration | ðŸ”„ In Progress | - |
| **Phase 4** | Testing and Documentation | ðŸ”„ Upcoming | - |

## Key Metrics

- **Initial Callback Route Complexity**: ~500 lines of code with deeply nested error handling
- **Current Callback Route Complexity**: ~60 lines with clean error handling âœ…
- **Test Coverage Goal**: >80% for auth services
- **Estimated Implementation Time**: 1 week (reduced from initial 2 weeks estimate)

## Notes & Observations

- The new architecture significantly improves maintainability by centralizing auth logic
- The server-side auth service handles all complex profile and role management cases with a structured approach
- The callback route complexity has been dramatically reduced (500 lines â†’ 60 lines)
- Type safety has been improved with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Error handling is now consistent and centralized with user-friendly messages
- The new structure provides a clean foundation for testing and future extensions
- The implementation follows clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns
