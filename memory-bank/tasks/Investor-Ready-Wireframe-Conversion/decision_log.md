# Decision Log: Investor-Ready-Wireframe-Conversion

This document records key decisions made during the wireframe conversion process, including rationales and alternatives considered.

## 1. Mock Authentication Approach

**Decision**: Implement a localStorage-based authentication system with a React Context Provider

**Date**: 3/20/2025

**Rationale**:
- Provides persistence across page refreshes without backend
- Simpler implementation than cookie-based alternatives
- Closely mirrors how the Supabase auth provider works
- Can easily simulate session expiration
- Compatible with Next.js App Router

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Cookie-based authentication: More secure but adds complexity
- In-memory only: Simpler but would lose state on refresh
- URL-based parameters: Visible in the URL, less secure and less user-friendly

**Implementation Notes**:
- Will need to handle role-based access control in the context provider
- Will simulate JWT tokens for authentication header consistency
- Will preserve the same interface as the current auth service

## 2. Mock Data Structure

**Decision**: Use TypeScript files with exported constants for mock data rather than JSON files

**Date**: 3/20/2025

**Rationale**:
- Allows using TypeScript types for data validation
- Easier to implement references between entities
- Can include helper functions in the same files
- Better IDE support with autocompletion
- Can use comments to document data structure

**Alternatives Considered**:
- JSON files: More realistic for API responses but less flexible
- Database in the browser: More powerful but excessive for wireframe needs
- Dynamic data generation: More realistic variation but less predictable

**Implementation Notes**:
- Will organize by entity type (users, equipment, etc.)
- Will maintain referential integrity between entities
- Will include realistic test data covering all edge cases

## 3. API Route Implementation

**Decision**: Keep API routes but replace backend calls with mock data

**Date**: 3/20/2025

**Rationale**:
- Maintains the same fetching pattern as the real application
- Allows realistic network timing simulation
- Preserves API contract for future implementation
- Easier transition back to real API when needed
- Better separation of concerns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct data imports: Simpler but breaks the API contract pattern
- Client-side only data access: Reduces code duplication but breaks architectural pattern
- Service worker mock: More powerful but adds complexity

**Implementation Notes**:
- Will add artificial delays to simulate network latency
- Will implement the same error handling as the real API
- Will maintain exact response format for compatibility

## 4. Integration Simplification

**Decision**: Create facade classes that mimic real integration adapters with simplified implementations

**Date**: 3/20/2025

**Rationale**:
- Preserves the adapter pattern from the real implementation
- Maintains the same interface for UI components
- Allows simulation of connection states and errors
- Provides realistic behavior for demonstrations
- Easier to add real implementation later

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Completely stubbed interfaces: Simpler but less realistic
- Simplified real API calls: More realistic but requires credentials
- Component-specific mock data: Easier to implement but breaks architecture

**Implementation Notes**:
- Will implement all methods from the real adapters
- Will use static data but simulate asynchronous behavior
- Will simulate connection status and authentication flows

## 5. Authentication Flow Visualization

**Decision**: Implement a simulated OAuth flow for Google authentication

**Date**: 3/20/2025

**Rationale**:
- Maintains visual fidelity of the authentication experience
- Demonstrates the complete user journey
- Shows the integration capabilities to investors
- Requires no real Google credentials
- Can control the simulated response

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Remove OAuth flow entirely: Simpler but less comprehensive
- Use a simplified login form: Less realistic
- Fake redirect: Confusing user experience

**Implementation Notes**:
- Will create a simulated Google login page
- Will handle the redirect flow with predefined responses
- Will preserve the visual appearance of the OAuth process

## 6. Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Optimize for static generation where possible but maintain SSR compatibility

**Date**: 3/20/2025

**Rationale**:
- Faster page loads for demonstration
- Reduced server dependencies
- Better reliability for presentations
- Simpler deployment process
- Maintains Next.js SSR pattern for future implementation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Full static export: Maximum performance but loses SSR features
- Keep full SSR: More aligned with production but more complex
- Switch to a simpler framework: Would require significant rewrite

**Implementation Notes**:
- Will use Next.js Static Site Generation where appropriate
- Will maintain compatibility with Vercel deployment
- Will optimize build configuration for wireframe mode

## 7. Environment Configuration

**Decision**: Use environment variables to toggle between mock and real implementations

**Date**: 3/20/2025

**Rationale**:
- Allows easy switching between wireframe and real modes
- Maintains a single codebase for both versions
- Simplifies future transition back to full implementation
- Follows established pattern for environment configuration
- Allows partial enabling of real features if needed

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate codebase: Cleaner separation but maintenance overhead
- Build-time configuration: Simpler but less flexible
- Feature flags system: More powerful but overkill for this use case

**Implementation Notes**:
- Will use `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_ENABLED=true` as the main toggle
- Will implement helper functions to check environment
- Will allow configuration of simulation parameters (delays, etc.)

## 8. Role-Based Access Control

**Decision**: Implement client-side authorization checks without Supabase RLS

**Date**: 3/20/2025

**Rationale**:
- Simulates the security model without database dependencies
- Maintains the same UI behavior for different roles
- Allows demonstration of role-specific features
- Simpler implementation than true RLS
- Fits with localStorage-based authentication

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Ignore role restrictions: Simpler but less realistic
- Mock RLS in API routes: More complex but more accurate
- Hardcode specific views: Inflexible for demonstrations

**Implementation Notes**:
- Will implement helper functions for authorization checks
- Will maintain the same redirect pattern as the real app
- Will include adequate protection for demonstration purposes only

## 9. Visual Consistency Approach

**Decision**: Prioritize visual components and defer non-visual optimizations

**Date**: 3/20/2025

**Rationale**:
- Focus on what investors will actually see
- Maximize impact with limited development time
- Maintain the appearance of full functionality
- Ensure a smooth demonstration experience
- Align with the primary goal of investor presentations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Full functionality simulation: More comprehensive but time-consuming
- Skeleton-only interface: Faster but less impressive
- Screenshots/mockups: Much simpler but not interactive

**Implementation Notes**:
- Will implement all visual components with full styling
- Will prioritize user flows most likely to be demonstrated
- Will ensure smooth transitions and loading states

## 10. Mock Data Quantity vs. Quality

**Decision**: Create fewer, high-quality mock entities rather than many low-detail entities

**Date**: 3/20/2025

**Rationale**:
- More realistic demonstration with detailed mock data
- Better showcases UI capabilities with rich content
- Easier to maintain and ensure consistency
- More compelling for investor presentations
- Better demonstrates real-world use cases

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Large quantity of simple entities: More realistic volume but less detail
- Dynamically generated data: More variety but less control
- Minimal placeholder data: Faster to implement but less impressive

**Implementation Notes**:
- Will create 5-10 high-quality examples for each entity type
- Will ensure diverse examples covering different scenarios
- Will focus on realism and completeness of each example
