# Progress Tracker: Investor-Ready-Wireframe-Conversion

This document tracks the progress of the wireframe conversion task, organized by phases of implementation.

## Phase 1: Setup Mock Environment

- [ ] Create mock data directory structure
- [ ] Define base mock data types
- [ ] Implement mock authentication context
- [ ] Create mock user data with different roles
- [ ] Design mock data service interface
- [ ] Setup environment variable configuration for wireframe mode

## Phase 2: Authentication Replacement

- [ ] Implement localStorage-based session management
- [ ] Create mock authentication provider
- [ ] Implement mock login/signup functionality
- [ ] Create mock OAuth flow simulation
- [ ] Update login and signup UI components to use mock auth
- [ ] Implement role-based access control with mock auth
- [ ] Create user profile mock data

## Phase 3: Database Replacement

- [ ] Create static JSON files for all entity types:
  - [ ] Users and profiles
  - [ ] Equipment and categories
  - [ ] Rentals and booking information
  - [ ] Events and timelines
  - [ ] Venues and specifications
  - [ ] Documents and contracts
- [ ] Implement mock data services for each entity type
- [ ] Create mock API routes to replace Supabase queries
- [ ] Update components to use mock data services
- [ ] Implement client-side filtering and pagination
- [ ] Create in-memory CRUD operations simulation

## Phase 4: Integration Simplification

- [ ] Implement Google Workspace mocks:
  - [ ] Mock Drive integration with static file data
  - [ ] Mock Calendar integration with static event data
  - [ ] Mock Tasks integration with static task data
- [ ] Create mock Current RMS integration:
  - [ ] Mock equipment catalog
  - [ ] Mock rental management
- [ ] Implement mock DocuSign/Adobe integration for document signing
- [ ] Create mock integration manager
- [ ] Implement connection status simulation
- [ ] Update integration UI components to use mock data

## Phase 5: Deployment Optimization

- [ ] Clean up unnecessary dependencies
- [ ] Update Next.js configuration
- [ ] Create mock assets for static file references
- [ ] Optimize image assets for faster loading
- [ ] Configure Vercel deployment settings
- [ ] Test build process without backend dependencies
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for edge cases

## Current Status

**Overall Progress**: Planning Phase

### Completed Items

- âœ… Task definition and planning
- âœ… Memory bank documentation creation
- âœ… Architecture design for wireframe version

### In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Creating detailed implementation plans
- ðŸ”„ Documenting patterns and approaches

### Next Steps

1. Start implementing the mock authentication system
2. Create static JSON data files for core entities
3. Implement the first mock data services

## Challenges and Blockers

| Challenge | Description | Status | Resolution |
|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Maintaining referential integrity | Ensuring mock data maintains proper relationships between entities | Not Started | Will implement helper functions to maintain consistent references |
| Role-based access simulation | Reproducing role-based security without database RLS | Not Started | Will implement client-side access control in mock auth context |
| Integration behavior fidelity | Making mock integrations behave realistically | Not Started | Will add artificial delays and proper error simulation |

## Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Complete planning and documentation | Day 1 | In Progress |
| Implement authentication replacement | Day 2-3 | Not Started |
| Complete data service mocks | Day 4-5 | Not Started |
| Finish integration replacements | Day 6-7 | Not Started |
| Optimize for deployment | Day 8 | Not Started |
| Final testing and adjustments | Day 9-10 | Not Started |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Visual inconsistency with real app | High | Medium | Thorough testing of all UI components with mock data |
| Performance issues with client-side operations | Medium | Low | Optimize mock data structure and implement pagination |
| Missing edge cases in mock implementations | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive testing across different user roles and scenarios |
| Deployment issues | High | Low | Test deployment early and often during development |

## Success Metrics

- All pages render with correct layout and styling
- Navigation between pages works seamlessly
- Role-based UI differences are preserved
- Authentication flows work visually
- Integration displays show realistic data
- Application deploys successfully to Vercel
- No console errors during normal operation
