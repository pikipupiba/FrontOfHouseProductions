## Notes

The task has pivoted from a dual-mode approach to a wireframe-only implementation. This decision simplifies the codebase and improves maintainability by removing conditional logic and environment variable checks.

The mock data implementation now includes comprehensive venue details and rental information, providing a realistic data layer for the wireframe demonstration.
