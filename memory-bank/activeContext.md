# Active Context

## Current Focus

The Front of House Productions (FOHP) web application project has successfully completed the initial foundation phase, with all main site pages and the landing page fully implemented. We are now moving into the customer and employee portal development phases. Currently, we are:

1. Completing the user authentication experience with profile management
2. Preparing to develop the customer portal core features
3. Refining the UI/UX with consistent design elements across pages
4. Planning for employee portal implementation
5. Addressing technical improvements like ESLint issues

### Navigation Structure Redesign: âœ… COMPLETED

The generic dashboard page (`/dashboard`) has been successfully restructured:
1. Profile access directly in each role-specific portal âœ…
2. Improved navigation to keep users in their appropriate context âœ…
3. Fixed role-specific redirects âœ…

Completed navigation restructuring tasks:
1. Moved portal switching functionality to each role-specific portal âœ…
2. Updated authentication flow to redirect users directly to their appropriate role-specific portal âœ…
