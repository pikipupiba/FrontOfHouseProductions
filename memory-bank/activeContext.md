## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Authentication Strategy

- **Multi-Provider Authentication**: Using Supabase Auth with both email/password and Google OAuth
- **Google Authentication Flow**: Users can sign up and log in using their Google accounts
- **Profile Data Synchronization**: Syncing Google profile data (avatar, name) with our profiles table
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Maintaining role-based access for Google-authenticated users

### Architecture Decisions

- **Authentication Strategy**: Using Supabase Auth with JWT and role-based access control
- **Database Schema Design**: Focusing on core entities first (Users, Equipment, Events)
- **Component Structure**: Implementing a component library with a clear hierarchy
- **State Management**: Using React Context API with zustand for complex state and TanStack Query for server state
- **Tech Stack Expansion**: Adopting a comprehensive set of libraries to support upcoming features (see techContext.md)

### Integration Architecture

- **Adapter Pattern**: Using a consistent adapter pattern for all external service integrations
- **Caching Strategy**: Implementing Supabase tables as a cache layer for external data with background synchronization
- **API Security**: Routing all external API calls through our backend to protect credentials and implement rate limiting
- **Implementation Priority**: 
  1. Google Workspace (calendar, drive, tasks)
  2. Document management
  3. Current RMS (rental management)
  4. Financial systems
  5. Social media

### Open Questions

- Specific API credential management approach for production environment
- Webhook configuration for real-time updates from external services
- Authentication and data flow approach for multiple third-party integrations:
  - Google Workspace suite (Tasks, Calendar, Voice, Drive, Gmail) - In planning
  - Current RMS (customer data, inventory tracking) - In planning
  - QuickBooks/Xero (invoices)
  - Document signing services (DocuSign/Adobe)
  - Various social media platforms
- Approach for implementing the RFID scanning feature
- Implementation strategy for push notifications across devices
- Priority order for implementing integrations based on business impact
- Strategy for managing multiple OAuth authentication flows
- Data synchronization approach for offline/online scenarios

### Technical Explorations

- Researching best practices for Supabase row-level security with multiple user types

## Memory Bank Maintenance

The memory bank serves as my complete knowledge repository for this project. To keep it efficient and effective:

### Primary Reference Files
- **index.md**: Central navigation point for all memory bank files
- **Core Files**: Current and active information (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md)
- **Archive Files**: Historical context in memory-bank/archive/ directory
- **.clinerules**: Technical patterns and project intelligence

### When to Update Memory Bank
1. After implementing significant changes
2. When discovering new patterns or approaches
3. After resolving issues (document in core files, later move to archive)
4. When requested with "update memory bank"

### Archive Process
When information becomes historical:
1. Identify content for archiving (completed work, resolved issues)
2. Move to appropriate archive file
3. Update cross-references in core files
4. Update index.md if needed

> **Note**: For comprehensive navigation guidance, refer to `memory-bank/index.md`
