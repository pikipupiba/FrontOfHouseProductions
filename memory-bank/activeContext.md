# Active Context

## Current Focus

The Front of House Productions (FOHP) web application project has progressed from the initialization phase to building out key pages and UI components. Currently, we are:

1. Implementing the main site pages accessible from the navigation menu
2. Refining the UI/UX with consistent design elements across pages
3. Ensuring proper integration between server and client components
4. Fixing issues related to routing and authentication flows
5. Improving SEO with proper metadata configuration for all pages

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

- **Authentication Strategy**: Using Supabase Auth with JWT and role-based access control
- **Database Schema Design**: Focusing on core entities first (Users, Equipment, Events)
- **Component Structure**: Implementing a component library with a clear hierarchy
- **State Management**: Using React Context for global state and React Query for server state

### Open Questions

- Integration specifics with existing inventory management system
- Approach for implementing the RFID scanning feature
- Complexity of the Google Workspace integration
- Implementation strategy for push notifications across devices

### Technical Explorations

- Researching best practices for Supabase row-level security with multiple user types
- Investigating options for offline functionality for field employees
- Exploring file upload and management capabilities in Supabase Storage
- Evaluating real-time capabilities for task management features
- Ensuring proper module system compatibility in Next.js 15+ configuration files (.mjs files must use ES Module syntax)
- Configured Vercel deployment for Next.js applications
- Documented Supabase integration approach for backend services
- Implemented multi-role security with Row Level Security policies in the database schema
- Adopted newer Supabase SSR package instead of deprecated auth-helpers
- Identified and resolved ESLint issues in Next.js builds
- Implemented proper separation of client and server components
- Addressed Next.js metadata handling in client components by creating dedicated layout files
- Applied consistent UI patterns across all pages with Tailwind CSS styling

## Development Approach

The initial development will follow a phased approach:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Core infrastructure, authentication, basic layout
2. **Customer Portal Phase**: Equipment catalog, rental workflow, document management
3. **Employee Portal Phase**: Event information, task management, basic tools
4. **Advanced Features Phase**: Integrations, advanced tools, reporting

We have completed the initial Foundation Phase setup with functioning infrastructure. The application is now live at https://front-of-house-productions.vercel.app/ with the backend database in place. We are now moving into feature development.
