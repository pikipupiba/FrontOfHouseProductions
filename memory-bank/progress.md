## Project Status: Portal Development Phase

The Front of House Productions (FOHP) web application has moved from the foundation phase to the **portal development phase**. We have established the core infrastructure with functioning hosting, authentication, and database components. Role-based portals have been implemented with proper navigation and access control. A live version of the application is now available at https://front-of-house-productions.vercel.app/.

## Current Issues & Concerns

1. **Integration Complexity**: The integration with existing inventory management systems and Google Workspace will require careful planning and implementation.

2. **RFID Implementation**: Implementing the RFID scanning feature will require research into browser capabilities and possible native app bridges.

3. **Offline Functionality**: For employees in the field, some level of offline functionality may be required, which adds complexity to the application design.

4. **File Storage**: Managing potentially large files (photos, videos, documents) efficiently will require careful implementation of storage and retrieval mechanisms.

5. **ESLint Configuration**: Currently ignoring ESLint errors during builds with `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true` in Next.js config. We should address the specific ESLint issues (TypeScript 'any' types, unescaped entities, and unused imports).

> **Note**: Historical issues that have been resolved are documented in `memory-bank/archive/resolved-issues.md`

## Current Milestones
