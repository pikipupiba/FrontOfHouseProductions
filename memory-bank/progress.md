## Project Status: Portal Development Phase

The Front of House Productions (FOHP) web application has moved from the foundation phase to the **portal development phase**. We have established the core infrastructure with functioning hosting, authentication, and database components. Role-based portals have been implemented with proper navigation and access control. A live version of the application is now available at https://front-of-house-productions.vercel.app/.

## Known Issues

As the project has moved through the foundation phase and into portal development, we've identified and addressed several implementation issues:

1. **Vercel Environment Variable Truncation**: Fixed an "Invalid API key" error in the Vercel deployment (while local login worked fine) by correcting a truncated Supabase API key in the Vercel dashboard. The JWT tokens used as API keys are quite long and can get truncated when copying to environment variable fields.

2. **Module System Compatibility**: Next.js 15+ with files using .mjs extension must use ES Module syntax (export default) rather than CommonJS (module.exports). We encountered and resolved this issue with the PostCSS configuration.

3. **Integration Complexity**: The integration with existing inventory management systems and Google Workspace will require careful planning and implementation.

4. **RFID Implementation**: Implementing the RFID scanning feature will require research into browser capabilities and possible native app bridges.

5. **Multi-Role Security**: We've designed a Row-Level Security system in the database schema to handle different user roles (customers, employees, managers), and have addressed infinite recursion in policy checks with security definer functions.

6. **Offline Functionality**: For employees in the field, some level of offline functionality may be required, which adds complexity to the application design.

7. **File Storage**: Managing potentially large files (photos, videos, documents) efficiently will require careful implementation of storage and retrieval mechanisms. The database schema now includes a documents table to track files.

8. **Supabase Auth Helpers Deprecation**: The @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs package is deprecated in favor of @supabase/ssr. We're using the newer recommended package.

9. **SQL Syntax Errors**: Encountered and resolved a SQL syntax error in the migration script where `ALTER SCHEMA public REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;` was incorrectly used. REPLICA IDENTITY is for tables, not schemas. Replaced with UUID extension creation for proper function availability.

10. **ESLint Configuration**: Currently ignoring ESLint errors during builds with `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true` in Next.js config. This was necessary to deploy successfully, but in the future, we should address the specific ESLint issues (TypeScript 'any' types, unescaped entities, and unused imports).

11. **Client vs Server Components**: Identified and fixed issues with 'use client' directives in components. Properly separating client and server component code is critical for Next.js App Router architecture.

12. **Metadata in Client Components**: Fixed conflicts between 'use client' directive and metadata exports in the Contact page by creating a separate layout.tsx file that handles metadata. This follows Next.js best practices for handling SEO metadata in client-side interactive pages.

13. **Navigation Links**: Fixed links in the navigation bar that pointed to incorrect routes (e.g., "/login" instead of "/auth/login"), ensuring proper user flow throughout the site.

14. **Redundant Dashboard Page**: âœ… RESOLVED: The generic dashboard page redundancy has been eliminated by replacing it with an auto-redirect to appropriate role-specific portals. The dashboard route now serves as a routing layer that directs users to their correct portal.

## Next Milestones

1. âœ… **Project Setup Complete**: Repository initialized, base Next.js application running, Supabase connected
2. âœ… **Authentication System**: User registration, login, and role-based access control implemented
3. âœ… **Landing Page Launched**: Public-facing components of the site functional
4. âœ… **Complete User Authentication Flow**: Profile management and portal switching mechanism
5. âœ… **Portal Framework**: Role-specific portals with direct profile access
6. âœ… **Navigation Restructuring**: Removed redundant dashboard page with direct portal routing
7. **Basic Customer Portal**: Core rental management features operational with file upload and timeline visualization
8. **Basic Employee Portal**: Event information and task management operational
9. **Management Dashboard**: Approval workflows and reporting operational
