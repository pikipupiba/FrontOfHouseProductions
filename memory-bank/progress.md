- âœ… Memory bank documentation has been established
- âœ… System architecture has been designed
- âœ… Development environment setup with proper Next.js configuration
- âœ… Next.js development server running successfully
- âœ… Vercel hosting configured and deployed
- âœ… Hosting and deployment documentation created
- âœ… Supabase integration plan documented
- âœ… Database schema successfully implemented in Supabase
- âœ… Row Level Security policies established for all tables

## Known Issues

As the project is in the initialization phase, there are only a few implementation-specific issues that have been identified:

1. **Module System Compatibility**: Next.js 15+ with files using .mjs extension must use ES Module syntax (export default) rather than CommonJS (module.exports). We encountered and resolved this issue with the PostCSS configuration.

2. **Integration Complexity**: The integration with existing inventory management systems and Google Workspace will require careful planning and implementation.

3. **RFID Implementation**: Implementing the RFID scanning feature will require research into browser capabilities and possible native app bridges.

4. **Multi-Role Security**: We've designed a Row-Level Security system in the database schema to handle different user roles (customers, employees, managers), but we'll need to thoroughly test this implementation.

5. **Offline Functionality**: For employees in the field, some level of offline functionality may be required, which adds complexity to the application design.

6. **File Storage**: Managing potentially large files (photos, videos, documents) efficiently will require careful implementation of storage and retrieval mechanisms. The database schema now includes a documents table to track files.

7. **Supabase Auth Helpers Deprecation**: The @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs package is deprecated in favor of @supabase/ssr. We've installed both but are using the newer recommended package.

8. **SQL Syntax Errors**: Encountered and resolved a SQL syntax error in the migration script where `ALTER SCHEMA public REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;` was incorrectly used. REPLICA IDENTITY is for tables, not schemas. Replaced with UUID extension creation for proper function availability.

## Next Milestones

1. **Project Setup Complete**: Repository initialized, base Next.js application running, Supabase connected
2. **Authentication System**: User registration, login, and role-based access control implemented
3. **Landing Page Launched**: Public-facing components of the site functional
4. **Basic Customer Portal**: Core rental management features operational
5. **Basic Employee Portal**: Event information and task management operational
