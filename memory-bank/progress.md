## Known Issues

As the project is in the initialization phase, there are no implementation-specific issues yet. However, several challenges have been identified:

1. **Integration Complexity**: The integration with existing inventory management systems and Google Workspace will require careful planning and implementation.

2. **RFID Implementation**: Implementing the RFID scanning feature will require research into browser capabilities and possible native app bridges.

3. **Multi-Role Security**: Designing a security system that properly handles the different user roles (customers, employees, managers) will require careful implementation of row-level security in Supabase.

4. **Offline Functionality**: For employees in the field, some level of offline functionality may be required, which adds complexity to the application design.

5. **File Storage**: Managing potentially large files (photos, videos, documents) efficiently will require careful implementation of storage and retrieval mechanisms.

## Next Milestones

1. **Project Setup Complete**: Repository initialized, base Next.js application running, Supabase connected
2. **Authentication System**: User registration, login, and role-based access control implemented
3. **Landing Page Launched**: Public-facing components of the site functional
4. **Basic Customer Portal**: Core rental management features operational
5. **Basic Employee Portal**: Event information and task management operational
